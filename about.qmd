Welcome to my blog.  

I write in this blog about **omics** , __spatial biology__, and **data science**, sharing notes, tutorials, and reflections from my own work and learning. This space is both a personal log of what I am exploring and, hopefully, a resource you might find useful.  

The goal is to learn by writing, and to make the process open. If you are curious about similar topics, I hope you’ll find something here that sparks ideas or helps you in your own projects.  

If you want to know more about the broader scope of our research, I invite you to visit my [lab’s main page](https://arbones.github.io/adipo2/). There you’ll find details about our projects, publications, and collaborations.
