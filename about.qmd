This blog explores the intersection of __omics__, __spatial biology__, and __data science__. Here I will share notes, tutorials, and reflections from my work, along with occasional digressions, documenting my learning process in the open.

My goal is to create a practical resource for fellow researchers and students. I hope you find something that sparks an idea or helps solve a problem in your own projects.

This blog is a component of my research. For a comprehensive overview of our lab's projects, publications, and collaborations, please visit our [labâ€™s main page](https://arbones.github.io/adipo2/).
