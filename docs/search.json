    "text": "Single-cell genomics is growing at breakneck speed, generating massive datasets that demand specialized analysis. The challenge isn’t just the biology, it’s keeping up with the ever-expanding ecosystem of software, protocols, and resources. For many, navigating this landscape can feel overwhelming.\nThat’s where the awesome-single-cell repository comes in.\n\nWhat It Is\n\n\n\nCurated by Sean Davis and a broad community of contributors, this open-source GitHub repository has become a central hub for single-cell researchers. It’s a living, community-driven catalog of tools and resources spanning the field—covering RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, epigenomics, spatial transcriptomics, and more.\nThe project’s popularity speaks for itself: over 3.5k stars and 1k forks on GitHub, with more than 180 contributors actively keeping it updated.\n\n\n\nWhy It Matters\nSingle-cell datasets bring unique analytical hurdles: correcting noise, integrating across batches or assays, identifying rare cell types, or charting developmental trajectories. Each task requires carefully tuned methods, and the awesome-single-cell repo provides a roadmap to solutions.\nFrom basics like quality control and dimension reduction to advanced workflows for pseudotime inference or gene regulatory network analysis, the repository organizes the community’s best tools in one place.\n\n\nWhat You’ll Find\nThe resource is carefully structured to meet the diverse needs of the field:\n\nSoftware Packages – Key tools for transcriptomics (e.g., Scanpy, Seurat), epigenomics (e.g., ArchR, Signac), copy number analysis, and the emerging wave of single-cell large models (e.g., scGPT).\nMulti-Omics Integration – Approaches like LIGER, TotalVI, and MultiVI for combining modalities such as RNA, ATAC, and protein.\nSpatial Transcriptomics – Tools like BayesSpace, SpaGCN, and CellTrek for mapping gene expression in tissue space.\nData Portals & Apps – Public datasets and interactive platforms, including CELLxGENE and the EBI Single Cell Atlas.\nTutorials & Workflows – End-to-end guides, from Bioconductor pipelines to nf-core workflows.\nKey Reviews & Comparisons – Curated literature to help benchmark and select the right methods.\n\n\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThe single-cell field is complex and fast-moving, but the awesome-single-cell repository acts as a compass, pointing researchers toward the right tools, datasets, and learning resources. It’s a prime example of how community collaboration can keep pace with scientific innovation—and make the journey a little less overwhelming."

And it will keep happening until researchers stop mistaking a consumer office tool for a scientific data platform.\n\nGene Symbols vs. Calendar Dominance\nImagine you name a gene SEPT2 (Septin-2). Or MARCH1. Breathless lab techs think they wrote science. But Excel thinks it’s September 2. Or March 1. Silent autoconversion. By the time anyone notices, databases have been invaded by dates. A 2016 study found about 20% of genomics papers with supplementary Excel gene lists have such errors. (BioMed Central)\nTen years later: worse. A 2021 follow-up showed that gene name errors have increased, affecting ~30.9% of papers with Excel gene lists in a sample from 2014-2020. (PLOS)\n\n\n\nThe Great Covid Spreadsheet Slip\nPicture this: Public Health England (PHE) is collecting COVID-19 positive test results from many labs. Some send huge CSVs. Then, someone opens them in Excel, using or converting to old “.xls” format. That format can only hold ~65,536 rows. Any excess? Deleted from view. Just… gone.\nThousands of positive tests (15,841, in fact) were not included in official figures during a period in 2020. Tracing people who should have been told to isolate? Delayed. Infection chains kept growing. (The Guardian)"

Databases, R, Python, and specialized bioinformatics tools exist for a reason.\nEvery dataset that matters deserves version control, audit trails, reproducibility, and transparency. None of these live in Excel. And yet, in labs across the world, the fate of experiments, patients, and entire fields of knowledge continues to balance precariously on a spreadsheet."

    "text": "The AI-Enhanced Workflow Architecture\n\nI have implemented a Claude-assisted scientific writing system in all my Quarto projects using Positron (IDE enviroment) built on three pillars:\n\n1. Project Instructions (CLAUDE.md)\nThe CLAUDE.md file serves as the command center, providing Claude with:\n\nSystem architecture overview: Explains the Positron IDE environment, Quarto structure, and file organization\nCoding standards: Enforces tidyverse patterns, vectorization over loops, use of native R pipe |&gt;, and mandatory code annotations\nWorkflow protocols: Defines how to interpret results, write/edit code, and handle git operations\nQuick reference guide: Maps common requests to specific actions\n\nThis file essentially “programs” Claude to function as a domain-specific research assistant who understands both the technical environment and scientific goals.\n\n\n2. Context Profiles (.context/ directory)\nThree critical files shape Claude’s behavior:\n\nquarto-narrative-skill/SKILL.md\nThis is the heart of the enhancer system; a comprehensive instruction manual for transforming Quarto analyses into scientific narratives. It defines:\n\nInput requirements: Reads three files per analysis:\n\nThe .qmd source (code logic and structure)\nThe rendered .html (numerical results and outputs)\nThe index.qmd (experimental context and research questions)\n\nCore workflow:\n\nParse all input files to extract code operations, results, and context\nMaintain exact section hierarchy from the .qmd structure\nFor each section: describe code operations → report HTML results → interpret biologically\nApply strict writing style constraints\nSynthesize into cohesive narrative prose\n\nHTML parsing strategy: Extracts content from rendered HTML by identifying text between tags (&lt;p&gt;, &lt;td&gt;, &lt;pre&gt;), ignoring JavaScript/CSS, and pulling numerical values from tables and code outputs\nSpecial handling: Covers multiple comparisons, negative results, technical issues, and complex visualizations\n\n\n\nwritingStyle_OSmithies.json\nA structured specification of scientific voice inspired by Nobel laureate Oliver Smithies. Key constraints:\n\nVoice: Active, first-person agency (“We performed” not “was performed”)\nTone: Decisive, objective, authoritative—avoid hedging\nSentence structure: Under 25 words, one idea per sentence, linear flow\nData reporting: Specific values, explicit statistical significance\nFlow pattern: Context → Action → Result → Meaning\n\nExample transformation:\n❌ \"Analysis was performed using DESeq2\"\n✅ \"We performed analysis using DESeq2\"\n\n❌ \"Many genes were significant\"\n✅ \"We detected 347 significant genes\"\n\n\ngit_workflow.md\nEnforces version control standards:\n\nCommit format: Title line + bullet points explaining specific changes\nDistinguishes between detailed explanations (for analysis code) and simple messages (for documentation)\nExplicitly excludes AI attribution messages\n\nIMPORTANT: These files live inside the Quarto project\n\n\n\n3. The Invocation Pattern\nWhen I need to document an analysis, I fire up Claude code in a terminal window and use the next prompt to trigger the workflow:\n\"Write the analysis for xxxxxx.qmd\" \nClaude then invokes quarto-narrative-skill:\n\nReads the source .qmd file (understanding methodology)\nReads the rendered .html file (extracting results)\nReads index.qmd (gathering experimental context)\nApplies the Oliver Smithies writing style\nGenerates publication-ready prose that:\n\nMaintains the exact section structure from the .qmd\nDescribes what each code chunk does and why\nReports specific numerical results from the HTML\nProvides biological interpretation\nUses active voice, concise sentences, and precise terminology"
